# Job Simulation: Advanced Threat Investigation and Risk Assessment at TechNova Solutions

**Project Description**  
This Job Simulation was a practical activity to simulate the investigation and mitigation of advanced cyber threats in a fictional corporate environment called *TechNova Solutions*. The focus was on analyzing the activities of the advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as *APT34*, which conducted complex attacks against the company. The task included identifying and analyzing attacks, assessing risks to the company’s assets, and proposing strategies for prevention and mitigation.

## Job Simulation Objective  
Investigate the actions of APT34 against TechNova Solutions, identify exploited vulnerabilities, conduct a comprehensive risk assessment, and propose effective measures to protect the infrastructure against advanced persistent threats.

## Skills Acquired and Practical Examples from the Project

### Investigation of APT34  
- Analyzed attacks conducted by APT34, which used spear phishing and zero-day vulnerabilities to infiltrate TechNova’s network.  
- Used **Splunk** for log analysis and correlation of suspicious events, detecting access attempts and lateral movement by the attacker.  
- Captured and analyzed network traffic with **Wireshark**, identifying malicious communications with APT34’s command and control (C2) servers.

### Risk Assessment  
- Mapped critical assets and assessed vulnerabilities exploited by APT34.  
- Classified risks based on likelihood and impact, prioritizing systems essential to TechNova’s business.  
- Reinforced recommendations for technical controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), network segmentation, and continuous monitoring via SIEM.  
- Simulated spear phishing attacks to train employees, enhancing awareness and reducing human risk factors.

## Tools and Techniques Applied  
- **Splunk** for advanced event correlation and automatic alert generation.  
- **Wireshark** for detailed network traffic analysis.  
- Practical social engineering tests to evaluate human security awareness.

---

## Documentation and Communication  
- Produced a detailed technical report outlining findings on APT34’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), risk assessment, and mitigation recommendations.  
- Presented the report to management, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures and investments.

## Lessons Learned from the Job Simulation  
This project provided deep insights into the dynamics of advanced threats and the importance of thorough investigation across multiple fronts to protect an organization. I learned to interpret and correlate technical data from various sources, build risk assessments focused on business impact, and develop technical communication skills to translate complex findings into clear recommendations for decision-makers. This experience highlighted the importance of proactive security and organizational awareness.
